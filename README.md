**Kaputa2004 to Singlish Unicode Converter**

Windows 7 and newer operating systems do not support Kaputa2004 and only support Kaputa Unicode. To bridge this gap, I've developed a web-based tool that converts Kaputa2004 text into Unicode. 

Please note that some characters might not be translated perfectly, as I couldn't identify the ASCII for certain Sinhala letters. Nevertheless, the tool should suffice for most uses, providing legible text that can be manually adjusted if needed.
