Kaputa2004 to Singlish Unicode Convertor

As Windows 7 above operating system does not suppot Kaputa2004 and only support Kaputa unicode , i have created a website to convert your kaputa2004 text into unicode .
some charactors are not perfectly correctly as i could not find the ASCII for some sinhala letters , anyhow this works fine to understand the text , later on you can change it with unicode text
